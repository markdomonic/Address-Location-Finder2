# Address-Location-Finder2
Initial project to practice HTML, CSS and Javascript
Basic Idea is to provide a web page that finds the address and provides a location via google map

- Initial build is about basic processing of fields and calling API's
- Then to refine processing and error handling
- Later to refine the styling & UX
